            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majeſties Anſwer To the nineteen PROPOSITIONS of both Houſes of PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore We ſhall give you Our Anſwer to your Petition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, We ſhall tell you, that We are now clearly ſatisfied, why the Method, which We traced out to you by Our Meſſage of the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of January, and have ſince ſo often preſſed upon you, as the proper way to compoſe the diſtractions of this Kingdom, and render it truly happy, hath been hitherto declined, and is at length thought fit to be looked upon; We now ſee plainly (and deſire that you, and all other Our good Subjects ſhould do ſo too) that the Cabaliſts of this buſineſſe have with great Prudence reſerved themſelves, untill due preparations ſhould be made for their Deſigne.</p>
            <p>If they had unſeaſonably vented ſuch Propoſitions, as the Wiſdom and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie of your Predeceſſours never thought fit to offer to any of Our Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours, nor We in honour or regard to Our Regall authority (which God hath entruſted Us with for the good of Our People) could receive without juſt indignation (and ſuch many of your preſent Propoſitions are) their hopes would ſoon have been blaſted, and thoſe Perſons, to whom Offices, Honours, Power and Commands were deſigned, by ſuch ill timing of their buſineſſe, would have failed of their expectation, not without a Brand upon the attempt. Therefore, before any of this nature ſhould appear, they have (certainly with great wiſdom in the Conduct of it) thought fit to remove a troubleſome Rub in their way, <hi>The Law;</hi> To this end, (that they might undermine the very foundations of it) a new Power hath been aſſumed to interpret and declare Laws without Us by extemporary Votes, without any Caſe judicially before either Houſe (which is in effect the ſame thing as to make Laws without Us) Orders and Ordinances made onely by both Houſes (tending to a pure arbitrary power) were preſſed upon the people as Laws, and their obedience required to them.</p>
            <p>Their next ſtep was, To erect an upſtart Authority without Us, (in whom, and onely in whom the Laws of this Realm have placed that Power) To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Militia</hi> (very conſiderable to this their Deſigne;) In further order to it they have wreſted from Us Our Magazine and Town of <hi>Hull,</hi> and beſtrid Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> in his bold-faced Treaſon; They have prepared and directed to the People unpreſidented Invectives againſt Our Government, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as much as lay in their power) to weaken Our juſt Authority and due eſteem among them; They have as injuriouſly as preſumptuouſly (though We conceive by this time Impudence it ſelf is aſhamed of it) attempted to caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Us aſperſions of an unheard of nature, as if We had <hi>favoured a Rebellion in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171709:3"/>Our own bowels;</hi> They have likewiſe broached new Doctrine, <hi>That we are obliged to paſſe all Laws that ſhall be offered to Vs by both Houſes</hi> (howſoever Our own Judgement and Conſcience ſhall be unſatisfied with them) a Point of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, as proper for their preſent buſineſſe, as deſtructive to all Our Rights of Parliament; And ſo with ſtrange ſhameleſneſſe will forget a Clauſe in a Law ſtill in force, made in the ſecond yeer of King <hi>H.</hi> 5. wherein both Houſes of Parliament do acknowledge, <hi>That it is of the Kings Regality to grant or deny ſuch of their Petitions as pleaſeth Himſelf;</hi> They have interpreted Our neceſſary Guard, legally aſſembled for the defence of Us and Our Childrens Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Traitour in open Rebellion againſt Us, to be <hi>with intent to leavie War againſt Our Parliament,</hi> (the thought whereof Our very ſoul abhorreth) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to render Us odious to Our people.</p>
            <p>They have ſo awed Our good Subjects with Purſivants, long chargeable Attendance, Heavie Cenſures and illegall Impriſonments, that few of them durſt offer to preſent their tenderneſſe of Our ſufferings, their own juſt Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and their ſenſe of thoſe violations of the Law, (the Birthright of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Subject of this Kingdom) though in an humble Petition directed to both Houſes; and if any did, it was ſtiſled in the Birth, called <hi>Sedition,</hi> and burnt by the common Hangman.</p>
            <p>They have reſtrained the Attendance of Our ordinary and neceſſary Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſervants, and ſeized upon thoſe ſmall ſums of Money which Our Credit had provided to buy Us Bread, With Injunctions, That none ſhall be ſuffered to be conveyed or returned to Us to <hi>York,</hi> or any of Our Peers or Servants with Us, ſo that (in effect) they have blocked Us up in that County.</p>
            <p>They have filled the ears of the People with the noiſe of Fears and Jealouſies, (though taken up upon truſt) tales of Skippers, Salt-Fleets, and ſuch like, by which Alarms they might prepare them to receive ſuch impreſsions, as might beſt advance this Deſigne when it ſhould be ripe. And now it ſeemes they think We are ſufficiently prepared for theſe bitter Pills, We are in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Poſture to receive theſe <hi>humble Deſires,</hi> (which probably are intended to make way for a Superfetation of a (yet) higher nature, (if We had not made this diſcovery to you) for they do not tell us this is all. In them We muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that theſe Contrivers (the better to advance their true ends) diſgulſed as much as they could their intents with a mixture of ſome things really to be approved by every honeſt man; Others, ſpecious and popular; And ſome which are already granted by Us, All which are cunningly twiſted and mixed with thoſe other things of their main Deſigne of Ambition and private intereſt; in hope, that at the firſt view, every eye may not ſo cleerly diſcern them in their proper colours.</p>
            <p>We would not be underſtood, That We intend to fix this Deſigne upon both, or either Houſe of Parliament; We utterly profeſſe againſt it, being moſt confident of the Loyalty, good affections and integrity of the intentions of that great Body, and knowing well that very many of both Houſes were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and many diſſented from all thoſe particulars We complain of: But We do beleeve, and accordingly profeſſe to all the world, that the Malignity of this Deſigne (as dangerous to the Laws of this Kingdom, the Peace of the ſame, and the Liberties of all Our good Subjects, as to Our ſelf, and Our juſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171709:3"/>Prerogative) hath proceeded from the ſubtill Informations, miſchievous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and evill Counſels of ambitious turbulent Spirits, diſaffected to Gods true Religion, and the Vnity of the Profeſſors thereof, Our Honour and Safety, and the publike Peace and proſperity of Our people, not without a ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the very actions of both Houſes. But how faulty ſoever others are, We ſhall (with Gods aſſiſtance) endeavour to diſcharge Our duty with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of heart; And therefore ſince theſe Propoſitions come to Vs in the name of both Houſes of Parliament, We ſhall take a more particular notice of every of them.</p>
            <p>If the 1.2.3.4.5.9.10.15.16.19. Demands had bin writ &amp; printed in a tongue unknown to Vs and Our people, it might have been poſſible We &amp; they might have charitably beleeved the Propoſitions to be ſuch as might have bin in Order to the ends pretended in the Petition (to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>the eſtabliſhing of Our Honour and ſafety, the welfare &amp; ſecurity of Our Subjects &amp; Dominions, &amp; the removing thoſe Iealouſies &amp; Differences, which are ſaid to have unhappily fallen betwixt Vs &amp; Our people, and procuring both Vs and them a constant courſe of Honour, Peace &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</hi> But being read and underſtood by all, We cannot but aſſure Our Self that this Profeſſion, joyned to theſe Propoſitions, will rather appear a Mockery and a Scorne; The Demands being ſuch, as We were unworthy of the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Vs by the Law, and of Our deſcent from many ſo great and famous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters, if We could be brought to abandon that power which onely can inable Us to perform what We are ſworn to, in protecting Our people and the Laws, and ſo aſſume others into it, as to deveſt Our ſelf of it; Although not onely Our preſent Condition (which it can hardly be) were more neceſſitous then it is, and We were both vanquiſht, and a Priſoner, and in a worſe condition then ever the moſt unfortunate of Our Predeceſſours have been reduced to, by the moſt criminall of their Subjects; And though the Bait laid to draw Vs to it, and to Keep Our Subjects from indignation at the mention of it, the promiſes <hi>of a plentifull and unparaleld Revenue,</hi> were reduced from generals (which ſignifie nothing) to deer and certain particulars, ſince ſuch a Bargain would have but too great a reſemblance of that of <hi>Eſaus,</hi> if We ſhould part with ſuch Flowers of Our Crown, as are worth all the reſt of the Garland, and have been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Vs from ſo many Anceſtours, and have been found ſo uſefull and neceſſary for the welfare and Security of Our Subjects, for any preſent neceſſity, or for any low and fordid Conſiderations of Wealth and gain. And therefore all men knowing that thoſe Accommodations are moſt eaſily made, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved, that are grounded upon reaſonable and equall Conditions, We have great Cauſe to beleeve, that the Contrivers of theſe had no intention of ſetling any firm Accommodation, but to increaſe thoſe Iealouſies, and widen that diviſion, which (not by Our fault) is now unhappily fallen between Vs and both Houſes.</p>
            <p>It is asked, <hi>That all the Lords and others of Our Privy Councell, and ſuch</hi> (We know now what you mean by <hi>ſuch,</hi> but We have cauſe to think you mean <hi>all) great Officers and Miniſters of State, either at home or beyond the Seas</hi> (For care is taken to leave out no Perſon or place, that Our diſhonour may be ſare not to be bounded within this Kingdom, though no ſubtile Inſinuations at ſuch a diſtance can probably be beleeved to have bin the cauſe of Our diſtractions and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171709:4"/>dangers) <hi>ſhould be put from Our Privy Councell, and from thoſe Offices and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, unleſſe they be approved by both Houſes of Parliament,</hi> how faithfull ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever We have found them to Us and the Publike, and how far ſoever they have been from offending againſt any law, the only rule they had or any others ought to have to walk by. We therefore to this part of this Demand return you this Anſwer, That We are willing to grant that they ſhall take a larger Oath then you your ſelves deſire in your 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Demand, for maintaining not of any part, but of the whole Law; And we have and do aſſure you, That We will be carefull to make election of ſuch perſons in thoſe places of truſt, as ſhall have given good teſtimonies of their abilities and integrities, and againſt whom there can be no juſt cauſe of exception, whereon reaſonably to ground a diffidence; That if We have or ſhall be miſtaken in Our election, We have and do aſſure you, that there is no man ſo near to Us in place or affection, whom we will not l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave to the Juſtice of the Law, if you ſhall bring a particular charge and ſufficient proofs againſt him; And that We have given you (the beſt pledge of the effects of ſuch a promiſe on Our part, &amp; the beſt ſecurity for the performance of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie on theirs) <hi>a Trienniall Parliament,</hi> the apprehenſion of whoſe Juſtice will in all probabilitie make them warie how they provoke it, and Us warie how We chuſe ſuch, as by the diſcoverie of their faults may in any degree ſeem to diſcredit Our election. But that without any ſhadow of a fault objected, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps becauſe they follow their conſcience, and preſerve the eſtabliſhed Laws, and agree not in ſuch Votes, or aſſent not to ſuch Bils, as ſome perſons, who have now too great an Influence even upon both Houſes, judge or ſeem to judge to be for the publike good, and as are agreeable to that new <hi>Vtopia</hi> of Religion and Government into which they endeavour to transform this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; (for we remember what names, and for what Reaſons, you left out in the Bill offered Us concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> which you had your ſelves recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Ordinance) We wil never conſent to the diſplacing of any, whom for their former merits from, and affection to Us and the publike, We have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, ſince We conceive, That to do ſo, would take away both from the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Our ſervants, the care of Our ſervice, &amp; the Honour of Our Juſtice And We the more wonder, That it ſhould be askt by you of Us, ſince it appears by the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Demand, That your ſelves count it reaſonable, after the preſent turn is ſerved, <hi>that the Iudges and Officers who are then placed may hold their places, quam diu ſe bene geſſerint.</hi> And We are reſolved to be as carefull of thoſe We have choſen, as you are of thoſe you would chuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and to remove none, till they appear to Us to have otherwiſe behaved themſelves, or ſhall be evicted by legall proceedings to have done ſo.</p>
            <p>But this Demand (as unreaſonable as it is) is but one link of a great Chaine, and but the firſt round of that Ladder, by which Our Iuſt, Ancient, Regall Power is endeavoured to be fetched down to the ground. For it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is not with the perſons now choſen, but with Our chooſing that you are diſpleaſed; For you demand, <hi>That the perſons put into the places and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe who ſhall be removed, may be approved by both Houſes;</hi> which is ſo far (as to ſome it may at firſt ſight appear) from being l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>It is demanded, <hi>That ſuch matters as concern the publique, and are proper for the high Court of Parliament</hi> (which is Our great and Supream Councell) <hi>may be debated, reſolved and tranſacted onely in Parliament, and not elſwhere, and ſuch as preſume to do any thing to the contrary, ſhall be reſerved to the Cenſure and Iudgement of the Parliament, and ſuch other matters of State, as are proper for Our Privy Councell, ſhall be debated and concluded by ſuch of Our Nobility</hi> (though indeed, if being made by Us they may not Vote without the Conſent of both Houſes, We are rather to call them <hi>your Nobility</hi>) <hi>and others, as ſhall be from time to time choſen for that place, by approbation of both Houſes of Parliament; and that no publike Act concerning the affairs of the Kingdom, which are proper for Our Privie Councell, may be eſteemed of any validity, as proceeding from the Royall Authority, unleſſe it be done by the Advice and Conſent of the major part of Our Councell, atteſted under their hands:</hi> Which Demands are of that Nature, that to grant them were in effect at once to depoſe both Our Self and Our Poſteritie.</p>

            <p>And to ſhew that no more Care is taken of Our ſafety, then of Our Power, after ſo great indignities offered to Us, and countenanced by thoſe who were moſt obliged to reſent them: After Our Town and Fort kept from Us (from which, if it were no otherwiſe Ours then the whole Kingdom is, We can no more legally be kept out then out of Our whole Kingdom, which ſure your ſelves will not deny to be Treaſon) Our Arms, Our Goods ſent away, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:171709:6"/>Our Money ſtopt from Us, Our Guards (in which We have no other Intention then to hinder the end of theſe things from being proportionable to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings) are not onely deſired to be diſmiſſed before ſatisfaction for the injurie, puniſhments of the injurers, and care taken for Our future Security from the like: But it is likewiſe deſired, (and for this Law is pretended, and might as well have been for the reſt, which yet with ſome ingenuity are it ſeems ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be but Deſires of Grace) that We ſhall not for the future raiſe any Guards or extraordinary Forces, but in caſe of actuall Rebellion or Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which if it had been Law, and ſo obſerved in the time of Our Famous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, few of thoſe Victories which have made this Nation famous in other parts, could have been legally atchieved, nor could Our bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> have ſo defended Her ſelf in 88. And if no Forces muſt be leavied till Rebellions and Invaſions (which will not ſtay for the calling of Parliaments, and their conſent for raiſing Forces) be actuall, they muſt undoubtedly (at leaſt moſt probably) be effectuall and prevalent.</p>
            <p>And as neither care is taken for Our Rights, Honour, nor ſafety as a Prince, ſo Our Rights as a private Perſon are endeavoured to be had from Us, it being asked, that it may be unlawfull and puniſhable, not onely to <hi>conclude,</hi> but even to <hi>treat of any Marriage with any Perſon for Our own Children, or to place Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours about them, without conſent of Parliament, and in the intermiſſion of thoſe, without the conſent of Our good Lords of the Councell,</hi> that We may not only be in a more deſpicable ſtate then any of Our Predeceſſours, but in a meaner and viler condition then the loweſt of Our Subjects, who value no liberty they have more, then that of the free Education and Marriage of their Children, from which We are asked to debar Our Self, and have the more reaſon to take it ill that We are ſo, becauſe for Our choice of a Governour for Our Son, and of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for Our Daughter, (in which the Proteſtant Religion was Our principall Conſideration) We conceived We had reaſon to expect your preſent thanks, and the increaſe of your future truſts.</p>
            <p>We ſuppoſe theſe Demands by this time to appear ſuch as the Demanders cannot be ſuppoſed to have any ſuch reall fear of Us as hath been long pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are too much in the ſtyle, not onely of equals, but of Conquerours, and as little to be intended for removing of Iealouſies (for which end they are ſaid to be asked, and that is not as Merchants ask at firſt much more then they will take, but as moſt neceſſary to effect it, which (if they be) God help this poor Kingdom, and thoſe who are in the hands of ſuch Perſons, (whoſe Jealouſies nothing elſe will remove) which indeed is ſuch a way, as if there being differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſuits between two perſons, whereof one would have from the other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall parcells of his ancient Land, he ſhould propoſe to him by way of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, that he would quit to him all thoſe in queſtion, with the reſt of his Eſtate, as the moſt neceſſary and effectuall means to remove all thoſe ſuits and differences. But we call God to witneſſe, that as for Our Subjects ſake theſe Rights are veſted in Us, ſo for their ſakes, as well as for Our own, We are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to quit them, nor to ſubvert (though in a Parliamentary way) the ancient, equall, happy, well-poiſed and never-enough commended Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government of this Kingdom, nor to make Our Self of a King of <hi>England</hi> a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and this of a Kingdom a Republike.</p>

            <p>There being three kindes of Government amongſt men, Abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Ariſtocracy and Democracy, and all theſe having their particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and inconveniencies. The experience and wiſdom of your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors hath ſo moulded this out of a mixture of theſe, as to give to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (as far as humane Prudence can provide) the conveniencies of all three, without the inconveniencies of any one, as long as the Balance hangs even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the three Eſtates, and they run joyntly on in their proper Chanell (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting Verdure and Fertility in the Meadows on both ſides) and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of either on either ſide raiſe no Deluge or Inundation. The ill of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy is Tyranny, The ill of Ariſtocracy is Faction and Diviſion, The ills of Democracy are Tumults, Violence and Licenciouſneſſe. The good of Monarchy is the uniting a Nation under one Head, to reſiſt Invaſion from abroad, and Inſurrection at home: The good of Ariſtocracy is the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Counſell in the ableſt Perſons of a State for the Publike benefit: The good of Democracy is Liberty, and the Courage and Induſtry which Liberty begets.</p>
            <p>In this Kingdom the Laws are joyntly made by a King, by a Houſe of Peers, and by a Houſe of Commons choſen by the People, all having free Votes and particular Priviledges: The Government according to theſe Laws is truſted to the King, Power of Treaties of War and Peace, of making Peers, of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Officers and Councellours for State, Judges for Law, Commanders for Forts and Caſtles, giving Commiſsions for raiſing men to make War abroad, or to prevent or provide againſt Invaſions or Inſurrections at home, benefit of Confiſcations, power of pardoning, and ſome more of the like kinde are placed in the King. And this kinde of regulated Monarchy having this power to preſerve that Authority, without which it would be diſabled to preſerve the Laws in their Force, and the Subjects in their Liberties and Proprieties, is intended to draw to him ſuch a Reſpect and Relation from the great Ones, as may hinder the ills of Diviſion and Faction, and ſuch a Fear and Reverence from the People, as may hinder Tumults, Violence and Licenciouſneſſe. Again, that the Prince may not make uſe of this high and perpetuall Power to the hurt of thoſe for whoſe good He hath it, and make uſe of the name of Publike Neceſsity for the gain of his private Favourites and Followers to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His People, the Houſe of Commons (an excellent Conſerver of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but never intended for any ſhare in Government, or the chuſing of them that ſhould Govern) is ſolely intruſted with the firſt Propoſitions concerning the Leavies of Moneys (which is the ſinews as well of Peace as War) and the impeaching of thoſe, who for their own ends, though countenanced by any Surreptitiouſly gotten command of the King, have violated that Law, which he is bound (when he knows it) to protect, and to the protection of which they were bound to adviſe Him, at leaſt not to ſerve Him in the contrary. And the Lords being truſted with a Judicatorie power, are an excellent Screen and Bank between the Prince and people, to aſsiſt each againſt any Incroachments of the other, and by juſt judgements to preſerve that Law which ought to be the Rule of every one of the three. For the better enabling them in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the examples of any of Our Anceſtors, We were willingly contented to oblige Our Self, both to call a Parliament every three yeers, and not to diſſolve it in fifty dayes, and for the preſent Exigent, the better to raiſe Money, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:171709:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>avoid the preſſure (no leſſe grievous to Us then them) Our People muſt have fuffered by a longer continuance of ſo vaſt a Charge as two great Armies, and for their greater certainty of having ſufficient time to remedy the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies ariſen during ſo long an abſence of Parliaments, and for the puniſhment of the Cauſers and Miniſters of them, We yeelded up Our Right of diſſolving this Parliament, expecting an extraordinary moderation from it in gratitude for ſo unexampled a Grace, and little looking that any <hi>Malignant Party</hi> ſhould have been encouraged or enabled to have perſwaded them, firſt to countenance the Injuſticies and Indignities We have endured, and then by a new way of Satisfaction for what was taken from Us, to demand of Vs at once to confirm what was ſo taken, and to give up almoſt all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the Power Legally placed in both Houſes is more then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent and reſtrain the power of Tyranny, and without the power which is now asked from Us We ſhall not be able to diſcharge that Truſt, which is the end of Monarchy, ſince this would be a totall Subverſion of the Fundamentall Laws, and that excellent Conſtitution of this Kingdom, which hath made this Nation ſo many yeers both Famous and happy to a great degree of Envie; ſince to the power of Puniſhing (which is already in your hands according to Law) if the power of Preferring be added, We ſhall have nothing left for Vs, but to look on; ſince the incroaching of one of theſe Eſtates upon the power of the other is unhappy in the effects both to them and all the reſt; ſince this power of at moſt a joynt Government in Vs with Our Councellors, (or rather Our Guardians) will return Vs to the worſt kinde of Minority, and make Vs deſpicable both at home and abroad, and beget eternall Factions and Diſſentions (as deſtructive to publike Happineſſe as War) both in the choſen, and the Houſes that chuſe them, and the people who chuſe the Chuſers; ſince ſo new a power will undoubtedly intoxicate perſons who were not born to it, and beget not onely Diviſions among them as equals, but in them contempt of Vs as become an equall to them, and Inſolence and Injuſtice towards Our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as now ſo much their inferiours, which will be the more grievous unto them, as ſuffering from thoſe who were ſo lately of a neerer degree to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and being to have redreſſe onely from thoſe that placed them, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may be inclined to preſerve what they have made, both out of kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and policie; ſince all great changes are extreamly inconvenient, and almoſt infallibly beget yet greater Changes, which beget yet greater Inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>Since as great an one in the Church muſt follow this of the Kingdom; Since the ſecond Eſtate would in all probability follow the Fate of the firſt, and by ſome of the ſame turbulent ſpirits Jealouſies would be ſoon raiſed againſt them, and the like Propoſitions for reconciliation of Differences would be then ſent to them, as they now have joyned to ſend to Us, till (all Power being veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Houſe of Commons, and their number making them incapable of tranſacting Affairs of State with the neceſſary Secrecie and Expedition; thoſe being retruſted to ſome cloſe Committee) at laſt the Common people (who in the mean time muſt be flattered, and to whom Licence muſt be given in all their wilde humors, how contrary ſoever to eſtabliſhed Law, or their own reall Good) diſcover this <hi>Arcanum Imperii,</hi> That all this was done by them, but not for them, grow weary of Journey-work, and ſet up for themſelves, call Parity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171709:7"/>and Independence, Liberty; Devour that Eſtate which had devoured the reſt; Deſtroy all Rights and Proprieties, all diſtinctions of Families and Merit; And by this means this ſplendid and excellently diſtinguiſhed Form of Government end in a dark equall <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion; and the long Line of Our many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anceſtors in a <hi>Iack Cade</hi> or a <hi>Wat Tyler.</hi>

            <p>For all theſe Reaſons to all theſe Demands, Our Anſwer is, <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari:</hi> But this We promiſe, that We will be as carefull of preſerving the Laws in what is ſuppoſed to concern wholly Our Subjects, as in what moſt concerns Our Self: For indeed We profeſſe to beleeve, That the preſervation of every Law concerns Us, thoſe of obedience being not ſecure, when thoſe of protection are violated; And We being moſt of any injured in the leaſt vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that, by which We enjoy the higheſt Right and greateſt Benefits, and are therefore obliged to defend no leſſe by Our intereſt then by Our duty, and hope that no Jealouſies to the contrary ſhall be any longer nouriſhed in any of Our good People, by the ſubtill inſinuations, and ſecret practices of men, who for private ends are diſaffected to Our Honour and Safety, and the Peace and Proſperity of Our People. And to ſhew you, that no juſt indignation at ſo reproachfull offers ſhall make Us refuſe to grant what is probable to conduce to the good of Our good People, becauſe of the ill company it comes in, We will ſearch carefully in this heap of unreaſonable Demands, for ſo much as We may (complying with Our Conſcience, and the dutie of Our Truſt) aſſent unto, and ſhall accordingly agree to it.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of which Search, in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Propoſition, under a Demand which would take from Us that truſt which God, Nature, and the Laws of the Land have placed in Us, and of which none of you could endure to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, We finde ſomething to which We give this Anſwer, That We have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the principall places about Our Children to perſons of Quality, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Pietie, with ſpeciall regard that their tener yeers might be ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Principles of the true Proteſtant Religion, as (by the bleſſing of God upon this Our care) this whole Kingdom may in due time reap the fruit thereof: And as We have been likewiſe very carefull in the choice of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants about them, that none of them may be ſuch, as by ill Principles, or by ill Examples to croſſe Our endeavours for their Pious and Vertuous Education, ſo if there ſhall be found (for all Our care to prevent it) any perſon about Our Children (or about Vs, which is more then you ask) <hi>againſt whom both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſhall make appear to Vs <hi>any juſt exception,</hi> We ſhall not onely <hi>remove</hi> them, but thank you for the Information; Onely We ſhall expect, that you ſhall be likewiſe carefull that there be no under-hand dealing by any to ſeek faults to make room for others to ſucceed in their places.</p>

Why do you then ask that in which Our own Inclination hath prevented you? And if you can yet finde any more effectuall Courſe to diſable them from Diſturbing the State or eluding the Law by truſts or otherwiſe, We ſhall willingly give Our Conſent to it.</p>
            <p>For the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> concerning <hi>the Votes of Popiſh Lords,</hi> We underſtand that they in diſcretion have withdrawn themſelves from the ſervice of the Houſe of Peers, (and had done ſo when uſe was publiquely made of their names to aſperſe the Votes of that houſe, which was then counted as Malignant as thoſe (who are called <hi>Our unknown and unſworn Counſellours</hi>) are now) neither do We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ſuch a poſitive Law againſt the Votes of any whoſe blood gives them that right, is ſo proper in regard of the Priviledge of Parliament, but are content, that ſo long as they ſhall not be conformable to the Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they ſhall not be admitted to ſit in the Houſe of Peers, but onely to give their Proxies to ſuch Proteſtant Lords as they ſhall chuſe, who are to diſpoſe of them as they themſelves ſhall think fit, without any Reference at all to the Giver.</p>
            <p>As to the deſires for <hi>a Bill for the Education of the Children of Papiſts by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the Proteſtant Profeſſion,</hi> many about Us can witneſſe with Vs, That We have often delivered Our Opinion, that ſuch a Courſe (with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it) would be the moſt effectuall for the rooting out of Popery out of this Kingdom; We ſhall therefore thank you for it, and encourage you in it, and, when it comes unto Vs, do Our Dutie; And we heartily wiſh, for the publike good, that the time you have ſpent in making Ordinances without Vs, had been imployed in preparing this and other good Bills for Vs.</p>
            <p>For the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, touching <hi>The Reformation to be made of the Church Government and Liturgie,</hi> We had hoped, that what We had formerly declared concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, had been ſo ſufficiently underſtood by you and all good Subjects, that We ſhould not need to have expreſſed Our Self further in it. We told you in Our Anſwers to your Petition preſented to Vs at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> the firſt of December, <hi>That for any illegall Innovations which may have crept in, We ſhould willingly concur in the removall of them; That if Our Parliament ſhould adviſe Vs to call a Nationall Synode, which may duely examine ſuch Ceremonies as give juſt cauſe of Offence to any, We ſhould take it into Conſideration, and apply Our Self to give due ſatisfaction therein; That We were perſwaded in Our Conſcience, that no church could be found upon the Earth, that profeſſeth the true Religion with more purity of Doctrine, then the church of England doth, nor where the Government and Diſcipline are joyntly more beautified, and free from Superſtition, then as they are here eſtabliſhed by Law;</hi> which (by the grace of God We will with Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie maintain (while We live) in their Purity and Glory, not onely againſt all Invaſions of Popery, but alſo from the Irreverence of thoſe many Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks and Separatiſts, wherewith of late this Kingdom and Our City of <hi>London</hi> abounds, to the great diſhonour and hazard both of Church and State, For the ſuppreſſion of whom We required your timely and active aſſiſtance. We told you in Our firſt declaration, printed by the advice of Our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:171709:8"/>Privie Councell, <hi>That for differences amongſt our ſelves for matters indifferent in their own nature concerning Religion, We ſhould in tenderneſſe to any number of Our loving Subjects very willingly comply with the advice of Our Parliament, that ſome Law might be made for the exemption of tender conſciences from puniſhment or proſecution for ſuch Ceremonies, and in ſuch caſes, which by the judgement of moſt men are held to be matters indifferent, and of ſome to be abſolutely unlawfull; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that this eaſe ſhould be attempted and purſued with that modeſtie, temper and ſubmiſſion, that in the mean time the Peace &amp; quiet of the Kingdom be not diſturbed, the Decencie &amp; comelineſſe of Gods Service diſcountenanced, nor the Pious, Sober, Devout actions of thoſe reverend Perſons, who were the firſt labourers in the bleſſed Reformation, or of that time, be ſcandaled and defamed.</hi> And We heartily wiſh, that others whom it concerned, had been as ready (as their dutie bound them, though they had not received it from Us) to have purſued this caution, as We were and ſtill are willing &amp; ready to make good every particular of that Promiſe. Nor did We only appear willing to joyn in ſo good a Work, when it ſhould be brought Us, but preſt &amp; urged you to it by Our Meſſage of the 14. of Feb. in theſe words, <hi>And becauſe His Majeſtie obſerves great and different troubles to ariſe in the hearts of His People, concerning the Government and Liturgie of the Church, His Majeſtie is willing to declare, That He will refer the whole conſideration to the wiſdom of His Parliament, which He deſires them to enter into ſpeedily, that the preſent diſtractions about the ſame may be compoſed: but deſires not to be preſſed to any ſingle Act on His part, till the whole be ſo digeſted and ſetled by both Houſes, that His Majeſtie may cleerly ſee what is fit to be left, as well as what is fit to be taken away:</hi> Of which We the more hoped of a good ſucceſſe to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſatisfaction of Our People, becauſe you ſeem in this Propoſition to deſire but <hi>a Reformation,</hi> and not (as is daily preached for, as neceſſary, in thoſe many Conventicles which have within theſe nineteen moneths begun to ſwarm, and which, though their Leaders differ from you in this opinion, yet appear to many as countenanced by you, by not being puniſhed by you (few elſe, by reaſon of the Order of the Houſe of Commons of the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of September, daring to do it) a deſtruction of the preſent Diſcipline and Liturgie. And We ſhall moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>give Our beſt aſſiſtance for raiſing a ſufficient maintenance for preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> in ſuch courſe as ſhall be moſt for the encouragement and advancement of Piety and Learning.</p>
            <p>For the Bills you mention, and the Conſultation you intimate, knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the particular matters of the one (though We like the Titles well) nor of the manner of the other, but from an Informer (to whom We give little credit, and We wiſh no man did more) Commonfame, We can ſay nothing till We ſee them.</p>
            <p>For the 11<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> We would not have the <hi>Oath of all Privie Councellors and Iudges</hi> ſtraitned to particular Statutes of one or two particular Parliaments, but extend to all Statutes of all Parliaments, and the whole Law of the Land, and ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly conſent <hi>that an enquirie of all the breaches and violations of the Law may be given in charge by the Iuſtices of the Kings Bench every Terme, and by the Iudges of Aſſize in their Circuits, and Iuſtices of Peace at the Seſſions, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and puniſhed according to Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the 17<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> We ſhall ever be moſt ready, (and We are ſorry it ſhould be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171709:9"/>thought needfull to move Us to it) not onely to joyn with any (particularly <hi>with the States of the united Provinces,</hi> of Which We have given a late proof in the Match of Our Daughter) <hi>for the deſence and maintenance of Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, againſt all deſignes and attempts of the Pope and his adherents,</hi> but ſingly (if need were) to oppoſe with Our life and fortune <hi>all ſuch Deſignes</hi> in all other Nations, were they joyned: And that for Conſiderations of Conſcience, far more then any temporall end <hi>of obtaining acceſſe of ſtrength and reputation,</hi> or any naturall end <hi>of reſtoring Our Royall Siſter and her Princely Iſſue to their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and Dominions,</hi> though theſe be likewiſe much conſidered by Us.</p>
            <p>For the 18<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> It was not Our fault, that an Act was not paſſed <hi>to cleer the Lord Kymbolton, and the five Members of the Houſe of Commons,</hi> but yours, who inſerted ſuch Clauſes into both the Preamble and Act (perhaps perſwaded to it by ſome who wiſh not that you ſhould in any thing receive ſatisfaction from Vs) as by paſſing the Preamble We muſt have wounded Our Honour againſt Our Conſcience, and by another Clauſe have admitted a Conſequence, from which We could never have been ſecured, by declaring, <hi>That no Member of either Houſe, upon any Accuſation of Treaſon, could have his Perſon ſeized without the Conſent of that Houſe, of which he is a Member,</hi> though the known Law be, <hi>That Priviledge of Parliament extends not to Treaſon,</hi> and if it did, any Member (the Houſe being for a ſhort time adjourned, and ſo their Conſent not being ſo had) how treaſonable ſoever his Intentions were, how cleerly ſoever known, and how ſuddenly ſoever to be executed, muſt have fair leave given him to go on and purſue them, no way, how Legall ſoever, after the paſſing ſuch a Clauſe, being left to prevent it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, We Conjure you and all men to reſt ſatisfied with the Truth of Our Profeſſions, and the Reality of Our Intentions; not to ask ſuch things as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves; That you Declare againſt Tumults, and puniſh the Authours; That you allow Vs Our Propriety in Our Towns, Arms and Goods, and Our Share in the Legiſlative Power, which would be counted in Vs, not onely breach of Priviledge, but Tyranny and Subverſion of Parliaments to deny to you: And when you ſhall have given Vs ſatisfaction upon thoſe Perſons who have taken away the One, and recalled thoſe Declarations (particularly that of the 26<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi>) and thoſe in the point of the <hi>Militia</hi> (Our juſt Rights, wherein We will no more part with then with Our Crown, leſt we inable others by them to take that from Us) which would take away the other; and declined the beginnings of a War againſt Vs, under pretence of Our Intention of making One againſt you: as We have never oppoſed the firſt part of the 13<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Demand, ſo We ſhall be ready to concur with you in the latter.</p>
            <p>And being then confident that the Credit of thoſe Men, who deſire a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Combuſtion, will be ſo weakned with you, that they will not be able to do this Kingdom any more harm, We ſhall be willing to grant our generall Pardon, with ſuch Exceptions as ſhall be thought fit, and ſhall receive much more joy in the hope of a full and conſtant happineſſe of Our People in the true Religion, and under the Protection of the Law, by a bleſſed union between Us and Our Parliament (ſo much deſired by Vs) then in any ſuch increaſe of Our Own Revenue (how much ſoever beyond former Grants) as (when Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were wealthieſt) Our Parliament could have ſetled upon Us.</p>
